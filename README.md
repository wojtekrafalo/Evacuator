# Evacuator
Simulation of people escaping brom a building.

Project not finished. I want to rebuild it and develop planned features:
+ Possibility to save and load projects.
+ Possibility to draw only vertical and horizontal lines
+ Possibility to add exits and stairs.
+ Real-time simulation.
+ Maybe better way would be to develop it in Unity.

I would use an Observer design pattern.
